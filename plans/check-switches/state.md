Mode: executing (plan READY, sha256 c396a859a965…); Run `run_3869f8caafaa`
Observed candidate: `/Users/marco/orca/workspaces/ssv-network-monitor/check-switches`, branch `plan/check-switches`, plan commit `00fe823`, CP1 frozen base `61307dd` (run directory tracked via the `.gitignore` exception)
Accepted candidate: CP1 → `plan/check-switches` merge `16432ad` (ACCEPTED WITH DEFERRALS: DF1 → CP2)
Effective policy: plan.md Global rules (D1 models, D2 QA policy: decided by Marco 2026-11-06); role documents `6548b79b…` / `ec154819…`; DEFECT-CLASSES `7daa55f6…`

## Active work

### CP1

Status: ACCEPTED WITH DEFERRALS (Marco, option A; merge `16432ad`, suite 2,395 passed, ruff clean). DF1 (QF3) owned by CP2.

### CP2

Status: PROVISIONAL — composed QA round 2 FAIL (second failed round). Round-1 findings and DF1 closed; new QF4 BLOCKING (real M5 re-enable: disabled framework id re-proposed → ValueError, still-true page never sent); QN2 NOTE (M5 id divergence after a repeat). Candidate `ff3841f` (`cs/cp2-r1`).
Assignment: none (waiting for Marco)
Next: Marco decides the QF4 route (third repair scope) or another disposition; then act on the answer only.

## Resume

Reconcile `git -C <worktree> log -1`, `git status`, Orca Run/Task state (`orca orchestration task-list --run run_3869f8caafaa`) and the last log event; then act on "Next" above only.
