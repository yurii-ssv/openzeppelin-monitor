Observed candidate: `/Users/marco/orca/workspaces/ssv-network-monitor/check-switches`, branch `plan/check-switches`, plan commit `00fe823`, CP1 frozen base `61307dd` (run directory tracked via the `.gitignore` exception)
Accepted candidate: CP1 → `plan/check-switches` merge `16432ad` (ACCEPTED WITH DEFERRALS: DF1 → CP2)
Effective policy: plan.md Global rules (D1 models, D2 QA policy: decided by Marco 2026-11-06); role documents `6548b79b…` / `ec154819…`; DEFECT-CLASSES `7daa55f6…`

## Active work

### CP1

Status: ACCEPTED WITH DEFERRALS (Marco, option A; merge `16432ad`, suite 2,395 passed, ruff clean). DF1 (QF3) owned by CP2.

### CP2

Status: PROVISIONAL — composed QA round 3 FAIL with NOTE-only findings (QF4 closed; QN2, QN3, QN4 NOTE). Candidate `4205b00` (`cs/cp2-r2`), report `qa/cp2-round-3.md` `14fb1e3a…`.
Assignment: none (waiting for Marco)
Next: Marco decides: accept CP2 with deferrals (QN2–QN4 owners/triggers) → merge `cs/cp2-r2`, suite + ruff, delivery smoke go; or a further repair.

## Resume

Reconcile `git -C <worktree> log -1`, `git status`, Orca Run/Task state (`orca orchestration task-list --run run_3869f8caafaa`) and the last log event; then act on "Next" above only.
